### Option 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for GitHub Pages deployment with automatic CI/CD.

#### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

2. **Push your code to the main branch:**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **The GitHub Action will automatically:**
   - Build your project
   - Deploy it to GitHub Pages
   - Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/hussle-space-ai-forge/`

#### Manual Deployment

You can also deploy manually using the gh-pages package:

```sh

```

**Note:** Make sure you have enabled GitHub Pages in your repository settings and set the source to "Deploy from a branch" with the `gh-pages` branch selected.

## Troubleshooting GitHub Pages Deployment

### Getting 404 errors after deployment?

This project has been configured to handle GitHub Pages routing issues:

1. **HashRouter**: The app uses HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter for better compatibility with GitHub Pages
2. **404.html fallback**: A 404.html file redirects users back to the main app
3. **SPA redirect script**: The main index.html includes a script to handle direct URL access

### Common issues and solutions:

- **404 on page refresh**: Fixed by the HashRouter and redirect scripts
- **Assets not loading**: Make sure the `base` path in `vite.config.ts` matches your repository name
- **Deployment not updating**: Check the Actions tab in your GitHub repository for build status
- **Custom domain issues**: Make sure to add a CNAME file in the public directory with your domain name

### Checking deployment status:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Check the latest workflow run for any errors
4. Your site should be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/hussle-space-ai-forge/`
